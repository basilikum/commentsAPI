Although GET function works, I don'tknow how to go about getting DELETE, PUT, and POST to work. I know itshould be simple, I just need a pointer in the right direction. My previous work using my local database is commented out in server.js and models.js, since I still want to retain that code.

Also, I don't think you need a port variable as that's included in the mongodb connection string. Edit: Just be careful about what you use for your password as github is completely open to anyone to see if this is going to be live code it wouldn't be hard to inject whatever they want into your DB. If this is live consider using DotEnv"
